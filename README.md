# About this Repository
Most projects listed in this repository were completed for the [Udacity Natural Language Processing Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892). Named Entity Recognition is an individual project done outside of the Udacity program.
## Bayesian Spam Classifier
This classifier uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam.
## LDA Topic Modeling
This program uses the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model and classifies text in a document to a particular topic.
## Machine Translation
This end-to-end machine translation pipeline takes English sentences as input and outputs their French translations.
## Named Entity Recognition
This program implements a Named Entity Recognition model using LSTMs in Keras.
## Part-of-Speech Tagging
This POS tagger is built with Hidden Markov Models using the Pomegranate library.
## Sentiment Analysis
This project entails two sentiment analysis models, one with a naive Bayes classifier, the other with recurrent neural networks.
## Speech Recognizer
This project contains DNN models that work as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) system.
